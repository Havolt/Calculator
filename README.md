Follow the link above to test out the app.

My attempt at creating a javascript calculator. In it I attempted to mkae the calculator as user friendly as possible. The calculator will show a string of all previous commands if the equals button is not hit after a succession of inputs. This allows the user to see what inputs that have made and make sure nothing has gone wrong.

I implemented a clear button which resets the calculator values all back to their initial amounts. The decimal system in the calcuator I attempted to correct the problem of floating mumbers by limiting it to two decimal places and using rounding. 

For the deisign of the calculator I tried to make it as similar to a normal storebought calculator to make it easy for new users to pick up and use.
